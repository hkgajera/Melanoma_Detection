We present an improved automated system for diagnosing skin cancers (melanoma) using deep learning techniques. 

Abstract:  we present an improved automated system for diagnosing skin cancers (melanoma) using deep learning techniques. We utilize a pre-trained deep CNN model (MobileNet) to extract visual features from dermoscopic images. Our method incorporates boundary localization and cropping to generate more relevant features. Skin lesion classification is performed using a set of classifiers. Validation on the PH2 dataset demonstrates promising performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
